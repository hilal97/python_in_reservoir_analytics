# Python in Reservoir Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
This notebook demonstrates how to analyze and visualize oil production data using Python. The goal is to provide insights into reservoir performance over time and eventually develop forecasting capabilities.

## 📊 What It Does
- Reads oil production data from CSV files
- Plots production rates over time using Matplotlib
- Performs basic data exploration using Pandas

## 🚧 Future Plans
- Apply ARIMA and regression models for production forecasting
- Add interactive dashboards (Plotly or Streamlit)
- Compare multiple wells and automate trend detection

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
